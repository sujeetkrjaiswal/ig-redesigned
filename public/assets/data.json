The area is home to Kenya's second largest elephant population. In many ways, community-based conservation is likely to be the only viable alternative for vast tracts of Africa, in the parts beyond agriculture and where big animals and nomadic pastoralists still make their home. The nearby Reteti Elephant Sanctuary (@r.e.s.c.u.e) is the culmination of a two-decade-long process of tipping conservation on its head‚Äîprotecting wildlife for, and not just from, people. It is as much about people as it is about elephants. \nUnfortunately, right now, the communities are struggling because of the pandemic, which has caused tourism to vanish. The threat to their livelihoods and to nature grows ever greater. All over Africa, conservationists have reported an increase in illegal bushmeat hunting, and they fear organized poaching of rhino horn and ivory could be next.

With a population of only 7,500, almost everyone in town knew and loved Rob. He was the kind of person who always went out of his way to help others, who would stop and buy a homeless person a sandwich and a coffee. He had three young kids with his wife Alice, an elementary school teacher who taught two of ours. It was a tearful sight yesterday, as virtually the entire town showed up at noon to line the streets, with proper social distancing, as the hearse made one last patrol around town. This time Rob had a little help, with a two-mile-long escort of police cars and motorcycles from all over the state. I‚Äôve been reading the news with all the statistics about the pandemic, but it feels so different when it‚Äôs personal. To get a sense of our community, check out the funding campaign for Rob‚Äôs family in the link of my profile @geosteinmetz.","thumbNails":[{"src":"/assets/thumbnails/e3770664-c5ad-478c-abbe-fbb37b905a89.jpg","config_width":150,"config_height":150},{"src":"/assets/thumbnails/77557ab8-0994-4e24-bb8f-36f05c66081e.jpg","config_width":240,"config_height":240},{"src":"/assets/thumbnails/6d8eb484-e724-4997-bd76-cd5c36afaaf2.jpg","config_width":320,"config_height":320},{"src":"/assets/thumbnails/75568148-6691-4e3a-9cde-2c75b0ffd6c2.jpg","config_width":480,"config_height":480},{"src":"/assets/thumbnails/c99695b1-31fc-4d85-9eef-e1f99bbbe4ba.jpg","config_width":640,"config_height":640}],"images":[{"src":"/assets/posts/16318802-da85-44b0-9563-5821a6912c8a.jpg","config_width":640,"config_height":640},{"src":"/assets/posts/7291116e-1608-4d00-a632-9b514338bd85.jpg","config_width":750,"config_height":750},{"src":"/assets/posts/66277fac-1470-4ae8-ba3c-6e15cd19258d.jpg","config_width":1080,"config_height":1080}],"isVideo":false}],"comments":[{"id":"f7a071ba-edd0-415f-a5e1-df63bd46e637","likeCount":16,"replyCount":3,"author":"readyoni","authorImage":"/assets/users/0e12cee2-9ac1-4fa1-9a0a-2a13d8f87e3a.jpg","commentText":"I love usa.

As it turns out, my father was in high school when he first heard about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. He graduated, saved his money, had a hernia surgery so he could qualify, and then joined the Navy as soon as he could. Clark served in the North Atlantic and the South Pacific on the U.S.S. Farquhar. He was a child of the Dust Bowl, or, as he says, the Dirty Thirties. Surviving WWII and the Depression are stories of his generation.

The Gr√©vy's zebra was used by the Romans in circuses, and subsequently forgotten for a thousand years. In the 17th century, the king of Shoa (now central Ethiopia) exported two zebras: one to the sultan of Turkey, and another to the Dutch governor of Jakarta. A century later, in 1882, the government of Abyssinia sent one to French president Jules Gr√©vy. It was at that time that the animal was recognized as its own species and named in Gr√©vy's honor. Its population was estimated to be 15,000 in the 1970s, and by the early 21st century the population was lower than 3,500, a 75% decline. Today it's believed that less than 2,500 Gr√©vy's zebras remain in the wild, and it‚Äôs considered endangered although stable. It's legally protected in Ethiopia, and in Kenya, it is protected by the hunting ban of 1977. In the past, Gr√©vy's zebras were threatened mainly by hunting for their skins, which fetched a high price on the world market. However, the main threat to the zebra now is habitat loss and competition with livestock. Cattle gather around watering holes, and the Gr√©vy's zebras are fenced off from those areas. Community-based conservation efforts have been shown to be the most effective in preserving Gr√©vy's zebras; their current habitat, now less than 0.5% of their traditional range, is in protected areas. Absolutely every time I see one of these magnificent creatures, my heart skips a beat.

For the past decade, being on the road has allowed me to move forward in time, perhaps so far ahead that reality ceases to be a concern. But it is clear this desire is elusive now, a form of escapism that is out of reach. The uncertainty of when this will all pass is all-consuming. You realize your thoughts are no longer your own. You can‚Äôt focus. Everything becomes smaller and smaller. You‚Äôre waiting for normality to be yours again. But it isn't, won't be. That forces you to pause, and understand that the way you work can no longer be the same. The way you interact with the world will be different. At least for now.

Currently we‚Äôre still open, but no one can come inside‚Äîinstead we are doing takeout, delivery, and pick-up. Our customers can still support us by ordering online, with zero physical contact. But we had to shut down the heart and soul of our brewery ... We have regular customers that come in all the time. .. we know their drink, their family members, so ordering online loses the personality of the business.\n\nThe good news is that our strong customer base is looking out for us and supporting us. And there are programs in the small- business community that are connecting us to each other ... Right now we have [COVID-19] as a common thread, and it‚Äôs bringing businesses together that otherwise wouldn‚Äôt normally have collaborated.

The arid climate of the region makes it possible to store the aircraft long term, without corrosion and weather damage. It is the largest aircraft storage and preservation facility in the world, handling nearly 3,300 aircraft. \nThe process of optimizing the life cycle of such resource-intensive machines is a leading example of what's called the circular economy. The remanufacturing and repurposing technology makes the most out of the planes; precious parts are dismantled and reused by the Air Force, and entire aircraft can be reassembled and put back into service. At the end of the life cycle, they can be scrapped for steel and aluminum recycling. \nThis image is part the cover story, the \"End of Trash,\" in the March issue of National Geographic magazine.

The bird surrenders its catch to the fisherman who rewards it with a small fish and goes back to work diving for another fish for its master. On a good day they might catch a dozen this way. When I took this picture back in the 90s, there were many engaged in this form of fishing, but it's now under threat as most find it more profitable demonstrating for the tourists. #yunnan #China #fishing #cormorants","thumbNails":[{"src":"/assets/thumbnails/ca741eee-1ea3-4b6e-b644-6d66050e687e.jpg","config_width":150,"config_height":150},{"src":"/assets/thumbnails/150e6b5f-5076-4932-ad3b-3af8439067f2.jpg","config_width":240,"config_height":240},{"src":"/assets/thumbnails/f974daf7-8972-4406-946c-b904a03407c6.jpg","config_width":320,"config_height":320},{"src":"/assets/thumbnails/17f1f88c-227a-4d50-baa5-eb4341fb0d1c.jpg","config_width":480,"config_height":480},{"src":"/assets/thumbnails/0873399f-cfbd-49f5-bb77-bbb5fd0ec03f.jpg","config_width":640,"config_height":640}],"images":[{"src":"/assets/posts/f2bd81d8-84d8-4410-a5a1-07dbb451cb3c.jpg","config_width":640,"config_height":640},{"src":"/assets/posts/8dbbb94b-76e8-4cae-8145-1f219e772554.jpg","config_width":750,"config_height":750},{"src":"/assets/posts/cba57e98-12f1-4a3c-93e4-8f56d7e95da5.jpg","config_width":1080,"config_height":1080}],"isVideo":false}],"comments":[{"id":"3a181363-c37d-47b0-ac66-764d212cef36","likeCount":10,"replyCount":8,"author":"profesyonel__koc","authorImage":"/assets/users/1bc8ee2e-1a36-4972-9da9-4c4eadd5ccc8.jpg","commentText":"üí´üí´üí´üí´üí´üí´üí´ @natgeo","createdAt":1589674118,"viewerHasLiked":false},{"id":"197aff5b-6636-4e3b-a624-364559fef8dc","likeCount":12,"replyCount":8,"author":"ange.line8929","authorImage":"/assets/users/757d0a4a-38e9-4a5d-8f00-48ae22d6fd90.jpg","commentText":"üëèüëè","createdAt":1589706386,"viewerHasLiked":false},{"id":"a8a42a2b-a87f-4941-bb8a-262b88300704","likeCount":5,"replyCount":4,"author":"hadihappyboy","authorImage":"/assets/users/b8952fa7-d680-4705-a35f-5eb493a9f482.jpg","commentText":"@kennethpe424 üëè","createdAt":1589711817,"viewerHasLiked":false},{"id":"238502af-a2ee-482a-9121-dcbb8599f4cc","likeCount":10,"replyCount":3,"author":"memora1950","authorImage":"/assets/users/6f1b8257-ee51-4129-8c87-f8dba9a655f5.jpg","commentText":"La naturaleza lo bello de nuestro mundo","createdAt":1589717499,"viewerHasLiked":false}],"author":"natgeo","authorImage":"/assets/user.jpg","commentsDisabled":false,"createdAt":1589320972,"id":"2307714020121817218","viewerCanReShare":true,"viewerHasLiked":false,"viewerHasSaved":false,"viewerInPhoto":false,"likeCount":285963},{"contents":[{"caption":"Photos by @gabrielegalimbertiphoto | Before the coronavirus crisis broke out, they were treated like endangered animals, destined to be suffocated in the coils of large-scale distribution.
